## Scrim Bot

This Discord Bot is written in Go it should help an Discord Server to schedule scrims and automate a little bit the process of creating team roles.

# Discord Commands

Im using the Discord Commands so the users can use an command to create their own Team.

The user can define a team Name and a color for his role that should represent the color of his team.

To get his players added to this role, he can use another command that let him add his players to his team role.
